# ToDoList

# Project Background

This was not supposed to be a functionally impressive project. In the workplace, I am a most of the time seen as a dotnet back end developer. 
From this, I have neve had the confidence to create an app from scratch. 
I took this project through the whole SDLC and deployed it at [this](https://collinscode.com) domain.

As a backend developer, I know what I'm doing in that area, so to abstract all of that noise I went with the simplest concept I could. A TODO list running client side using localstorage.

The front end has always been quite scary to me as I don't really have a knack for front end design and so I focused on that aspect as the challenge.
Although I used angular materials for the date picker, I tried to write as much of the CSS for the rest of the site by hand as possible and I think that I hit my design pretty well. 

If you dont think it looks good that's down to the design :/

I did run into issues, and the site's still not perfect, but I have learnt a whole lot about front end by JUST DOING IT. 

I then experimented with sass for css and html in the components to mimic the wireframe that I created in my design. 

This project is great as it can be progressed as little or as much as I like. Here are some things that I would like to get around to (or contributions are more than welcome)

- [ ] Sub Tasks within a to do task that helps the user decompose a bigger job
- [ ] Authentication and user specific tasks queried from a non-relational db
- [ ] Something with the date thats assigned and never seen again
- [ ] Light Mode
And much much more...

Like all small projects, this has been put on the backburner as another more interesting project has caught my eye. I have become much more front end competent from this and beyond however and have now been able to pick up angular in the workplace, which was my main aim.

I hope to one day come back to this. :)

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.3.

## Development server
